        <h3>about</h3>

        <p>
            Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly.<br>
            Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design.<br>
            Designers are toolmakers.<br>
            Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator.<br>
            Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution.<br>
            Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.
